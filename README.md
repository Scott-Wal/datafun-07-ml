# Start a New Project
# Follow the steps in our standard "Start New Project" workflow. Use your own notes from prior projects. Note: There is no #specification for the Module 7 project. Instructions are provided as we work through the process.

# For details and suggested commands, see Workflow: Start a New Project in Module 8. 

# In your browser, create a GitHub project repository with a default README.md. Name your repository  datafun-07-ml or datafun-07-applied.
# Clone your new repository down to your machine into your Documents folder. 
# Open your new project repository folder in the Documents folder of your machine in VS Code (if you haven't already).
# In VS Code, add a useful .gitignore file with a line for .vsode/ and .venv/ and whatever else doesn't need to be tracked in the repository. 
# In VS Code, edit your README.md to record your commands, process, and notes so far. 
# In VS Code, open a terminal - PowerShell if Windows, zsh or bash if Mac/Linux. 
# Use the terminal to git add your files and folders to source control, and git commit your changes with a useful message (e.g. "initial commit"), and git push the changes up to GitHub.
# Verify your GitHub repository.
# Since this project uses Jupyter, include an entry in your .gitignore for the Jupyter notebook checkpoints folder as well:
# .ipynb_checkpoints/
# Create and Manage Your Virtual Environment
# Create and manage your project virtual environment. Use your own notes from prior projects and/or review earlier assignments to get help with specific commands.  See this example from Module 4 for more information: PROJECT_VIRTUAL_ENV.mdLinks to an external site.

# Open your project folder in VS Code.
# Open a terminal window in VS Code (PowerShell for Windows, zsh or bash for Mac/Linux). 
# In the terminal, run the command `git pull` first, to make sure you have the current project contents on your machine.
# In the terminal, run the command `py -m venv .venv` to create a new .venv environment in the project repo. 
# In the terminal, activate your environment using the command for your operating system. 
# In the terminal, use `py -m pip install` command(s) to install necessary packages into your active project virtual environment.
# Edit your README.md to record your commands, process, and notes.
# Set your VS Code Python Interpreter so your installed packages will be available for import.
# In the terminal, run `git add .` then `git commit -m "msg"`, then` git push -u origin main` to add / commit / push to GitHub.
# Verify your GitHub repository.
# Make sure your README.md includes the purpose of the project, the virtual environment setup, and the commands you used to git add / commit / push to GitHub, and how to run your code. 

# Verify your work with a clickable link and a screenshot of your GitHub project repository after you've pushed these changes to GitHub. 

# If you accidentally get a .venv folder in your GitHub repo, you can remove it following these steps: GitHub: How to Remove .venv Folder from a Repo
